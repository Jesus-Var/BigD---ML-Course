# BigD---ML-Course
In this repository I'll be uploading my first Python exercises that I'm currently doing in the Google Colab platform while learning Big data and Machine Learning

In the folder BigD - M5 - 2023-05-02 you can find the next files:

Jesus - M5 - 01 - Python Notebook.ipynb file contains a brief review of the types of variables and conditionals

Jesus - M5 - 02 - Condicionales.ipynb contains only three conditional exercises

Jesus - M4 - 10 - Pandas.ipynb is the file for introduction exercises of the Pandas library

Jesus - M5 - 03 - Bucles.ipynb is the testing chamber for while and for loops

In the folder BigD - M5 - 2023-05-03 you can find the next files:

Jesus - SpaceX - 2 - EDA.ipynb is the file where I obtain data from SpaceX launches to learn basic commands to transform the data collected in the Pandas library from Python

Jesus - SpaceX - 4 - EDA with Data Visualization.ipynb are the first data visulalization graphics with the seaborn y matplotlib libraries

In the folder BigD - M5 - 2023-05-04 you can find the next files:

Jesus - M5 - 06 - Introducci√≥n a Machine Learning con Scikit-Learn.ipynb in this file I tried to improve some ML models with simple methods

Jesus - M5 - 09 - Folium.ipynb (This file is only inicialized and readed but not completed)

Jesus - Prophet - Predecir el valor de Bitcoin.ipynb in this file I implemented the Prophet model to the values of the Bitcoin currency to predict how it could perform the next year

In the folder BigD - M5 - 2023-05-05 you can find the next files:

Jesus - M5 - SPACEX2 - 5 - Interactive Visual Analytics con Folium.ipynb I practiced with the Folium library in Python to visualize the SpaceX launches sites, and if the different launches were a success or not

Jesus - M5 - SPACEX2 - 6 - Machine Learning Predicciones.ipynb in this file I compared the accuracy of some predictive models in Python after I trained with a shortened SpaceX data
