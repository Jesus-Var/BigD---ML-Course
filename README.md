# BigD---ML-Course
In this repository I'll be uploading my first Python exercises that I'm currently doing in the Google Colab platform while learning Big data and Machine Learning

In the folder BigD - M5 - 2023-05-02 you can find the next files:

Jesus - M5 - 01 - Python Notebook.ipynb file contains a brief review of the types of variables and conditionals

Jesus - M5 - 02 - Condicionales.ipynb contains only three conditional exercises

Jesus - M4 - 10 - Pandas.ipynb is the file for introduction exercises of the Pandas library

Jesus - M5 - 03 - Bucles.ipynb is the testing chamber for while and for loops

In the folder BigD - M5 - 2023-05-02 you can find the next files:

Jesus - SpaceX - 2 - EDA.ipynb is the file where I obtain data from SpaceX launches to learn basic commands in the Pandas library from Python

Jesus - SpaceX - 4 - EDA with Data Visualization.ipynb are the first data visulalization graphics with the seaborn y matplotlib libraries
