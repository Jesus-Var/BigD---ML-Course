# BigD---ML-Course
In this repository I'll be uploading my first Python exercises that I'm currently doing in the Google Colab platform while learning Big data and Machine Learning
Jesus - M5 - 01 - Python Notebook.ipynb file contains a brief review of the types of variables and conditionals
Jesus - M5 - 02 - Condicionales.ipynb contains only three conditional exercises
Jesus - M4 - 10 - Pandas.ipynb is the file for introduction exercises of the Pandas library
Jesus - M5 - 03 - Bucles.ipynb is the testing chamber for while and for loops
